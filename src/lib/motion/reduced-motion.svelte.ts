// Reactive mirror of the OS `prefers-reduced-motion` setting, exposed as a
// `.current` getter so any rune/component re-runs when the user toggles it.
// SSR-safe: defaults to false (no reduction) when `window` is unavailable, and
// the change listener is only attached in the browser. Every motion entry point
// short-circuits on this — it is the global gate for honouring reduced motion.
